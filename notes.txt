I need KOA api/routing add to this file that interact with the file system
   Get parent path and  list of Folders and list of file names and ensure I can add paths to the URL to get to any level of subdirectory
   Rename a single file name --post old and new file name and ensure I can add paths to the URL to get to any level of subdirectory
   Rename multiple file names --post old and new file names and ensure I can add paths to the URL to get to any level of subdirectory
   Get filenames in a path and ensure I can add paths to the URL to get to any level of subdirectory


-- next maintain a history of changes, so I can undo certain changes !

If you want myGotoStore to handle more complex argument logic, update the mock in a-mock-setup.js. For example:
javascript

registerMock(mockUrl, {
  default: {
    hello: () => "Mocked Hello!",
  },
  myGotoStore: (count, options = {}) => {
    const prefix = options.prefix || "Mocked";
    return `${prefix} GotoStore! Count: ${count}`;
  },
});

Update app.js to test:
javascript

console.log(myModule.myGotoStore(22, { prefix: "Super" })); // "Super GotoStore! Count: 22"

i think if i did a hider on JSON that can be just as good, ...
  -- present the entire json schema, ... then remove parts I don't what to view
  -- then scrub the json data for removing parts not mentioned
  -- also reverse, keep the parts I want to see
